# Getting started

## Create Solid Web app via template

We created a [template](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/solid-web-app-template) that 
helps you to get started with a Solid Web app.
It has the following features:

- [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer) to test with pods locally.
- [Comunica](https://comunica.dev/) for querying pods and other data sources.
- [Solid Authentication library](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js)
  for authenticating with an identity provider.
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle the JavaScript.
