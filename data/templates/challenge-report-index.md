# Challenge reports

[SolidLab Challenges](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/Challenges/) are technological challenges with 
a clear scope and expected outcome 
that someone should be able to resolve in maximum 3 months.
Once a challenge is completed, we write a report about it that includes
the solution, important technological decisions and assumptions, follow-up actions and future work.

## All reports
